# ðŸ§© Module 3: Guessing Game with Conditional Statements

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Module Matters  
- Introduces decision-making in programming through `if`, `elif`, and `else`  
- Enables the game to respond differently based on user input  
- Forms the foundation for logic-based programming  
- Makes the game fully functional with actual win/lose logic

## ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s New in This Module  
- Adds conditional checks to compare user guesses with the correct answer  
- Introduces basic program branching based on user input  
- Supports dynamic feedback (e.g., "Too high", "Too low", "Correct!")

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts Introduced  
- **`if` / `elif` / `else`**: Conditional structures that control the flow of execution  
- **Boolean Logic**: Evaluating expressions like `guess == answer`  
- **Game Logic**: Reacting to user input with appropriate messages and outcomes
